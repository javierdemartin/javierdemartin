# Running

Mantras and things I look when planning my training.

* Don't get injured, that's the key. Time off is lost fitness.
* Train your head as much as your legs. Mental aspects is more important that you might think.
* Log your runs. Any method is valid. Just be mindful of how much stress you put into your body.

These experiences are mostly focused around the marathon distance.

## Training

* Structure everything mainly around a 5 day week. Splitting them into a 3 day group snd a 2 day group. Both with the same number of kilometers in it. The second group should have the longest run in it.
* I like Pfitzinger plans. Not the best for your first marathon. High mileage plans.
* Long distance running requires a commitment of both time and effort.
* Your actual weekly mileage should match the current start of the plan. Don't start one if you're not fit enough. Recipe for disaster.
* I prefer to run fewer days in a week (4-5 days) with higher mileage than 5-6 days with fewer mileage.

## Racing

* Long runs are essential. My longest run sweet spot during long run is at 35 km. Find yours.
* Any kind of heat is gonna decrease your performance on race day. Doesn't matter how much you've trained in heat conditions.
* You should be able to run 32 kilometers and race the last 10. They are going to be tough. So you better get mentally prepared for  it. Extending your long runs is essential for this. You will know how your body is going to behave in those distances.
* Play mind games, 42 kilometers is a lot. Don't think about all the distance you have yet to cover. Divide it mentally in chunks of 5 or 10 kilometers. Your mind can easily be tricked. PIcture yourself on a familiar course or anywhere else. Dig deep.
* Stick to the pacers or a group of runners for as much time as possible. Trying to be on pace for all that distance can drain you mentally.
