Singlet is the running log you need to keep track of your progress as a runner. That's it, that's what you need to know.

Apple Watches, Garmins, Polars, even if you only use your phone. Every single source of data works and it's read by Singlet. Any device that writes workout data to HealthKit works. Singlet will then display all the relevant data you need to know so you become a better runner.

Notable features:

* Voice Over support
* Widget showing your latest workout data
* Health.app data analysis alongside your workout data
* A place that joins Health.app and Fitness.app data in a single spot

Heads up for developers, alongside this app I am maintaining [HKCombine](https://github.com/javierdemartin/HKCombine), an open source Combine-based wrapper for common HealthKit operations that I use in this application.

### Privacy

Singlet does not track you in any way. In fact it doesn't use any third party libraries. Everything stays on your device.
