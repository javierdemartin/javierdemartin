Mantras and things I look when planning my training.

* Don't get injured, that's the key. Time off is lost fitness.
* Train your head as much as your legs. Mental aspects is more important that you might think.
* Log your runs. Any method is valid. Just be mindful of how much stress you put into your body.

These experiences are mostly focused around the marathon distance.

## Training

* Structure everything mainly around a 5 day week. Splitting them into a 3 day group snd a 2 day group. Both with the same number of kilometers in it. The second group should have the longest run in it.
* I like Pfitzinger plans. Not the best for your first marathon. High mileage plans.
* Long distance running requires a commitment of both time and effort.
* Your actual weekly mileage should match the current start of the plan. Don't start one if you're not fit enough. Recipe for disaster.
* I prefer to run fewer days in a week (4-5 days) with higher mileage than 5-6 days with fewer mileage.

## Racing

* Long runs are essential. My longest run sweet spot during long run is at 35 km. Find yours.
* Any kind of heat is gonna decrease your performance on race day. Doesn't matter how much you've trained in heat conditions.
* You should be able to run 32 kilometers and race the last 10. They are going to be tough. So you better get mentally prepared for  it. Extending your long runs is essential for this. You will know how your body is going to behave in those distances.
* Play mind games, 42 kilometers is a lot. Don't think about all the distance you have yet to cover. Divide it mentally in chunks of 5 or 10 kilometers. Your mind can easily be tricked. PIcture yourself on a familiar course or anywhere else. Dig deep.
* Stick to the pacers or a group of runners for as much time as possible. Trying to be on pace for all that distance can drain you mentally.



--------------------------

* Longest run in a marathon and how many times should I goi over 30K?

every body is dfferent, people can achieve great results topping at 35K for example. 
Do far more longer runs that some plans prescribe. do at least 5 runs of 35K or longer. In some cases do one full marathon or at least the duration of the time you want to achieve.
Parts of those runs have to be at marathon pace and others slower. Never do a full long run at marathon pace. This kind of volume helps not to fade at the end of the race. This helps your body recognize how it will behave at that distance or time. It's an unconfortable sensatino but better have it on a training run than on race day.

* Easy running / recovery pace. Run at your own pace. There are more things to lose doing a recovery run faster than to gain from it. Do them at 70% of your max. You probably won't notice a performance improvement if you do them even slower than you're doing them now.

* How to avoid slowing down in the latter stages of a marathon? Do more long runs. they prepare your body for what it's going to go through on a marathon. Another reason is not fueling enough carbohydrates. If you run out of carbohydrates your body is going to switch its energy source to fats and that is harder. You're going to spend more calories than you're going to get into your body.

* Overall volume in a marathon

* Motivation

* Taper
