The year is 2020. I am graduating in a month and the world is still quarantining. Nobody knows what the future holds.

I am not running out of money, I am working some hours as a freelancer and pay is actually good. I won't be able to live out of my current salary once I graduate but it's great for now.  I am grateful to have found the people I have found these years that have motivated me and allowed me to keep learning and work.

Throughout this year I have done some interviews with companies and only received one offer, that I rejected for several reasons. I even interviewed for a dream company, so I guess I am on a good path but the road is getting bumpier.

I have studied to be a Telecommunications Engineer. I have a deep passion for everything related to communications, Internet and transporting information. But I also love to write software, thing that wasn't a core subject on either my BSc nor MSc. I decided to learn Swift to make iOS apps on my sophomore year. I don't know why. I have convinced myself it was because I had an iPhone and I wanted to see my code run on a phone. I kept learning over the years until I landed a job so I started to see the bright side of it. I could get paid to do things I enjoyed. Then some R, Python, Node.JS and other things followed because it felt great to learn new tools that allowed me to create things.

Unluckily the programming courses I had at uni didn't even taught us the basic O Notation or algorithms. I still think those things are important but it would have been easier if I had been taught that instead of some random coding couses. I am still horrible at live coding interviews. That doesn't mean I am not able to perform or even write code but I get nervous because the other person's sole job is to watch me. When I have a take home exercise I would say I am more comfortable or feel more confident.

The list of weird library of rejection reasons is evolving. For one job I knew too much for the level they were looking for or in other case that I knew more advanced concepts like Reactive Programming but failed to quickly response how much memory I needed to reserve in a special case for an array. This whole "system" is getting on my nerves because I don't know if I am even remotely good for "the system".

Companies should, and I guess they do, hire on the potential they see on people. I know technical interviews and algorithms can be a filter but they can also lead to false positives. Maybe I should study more algorithms instead of doing side projects on new and interesting things or work...
