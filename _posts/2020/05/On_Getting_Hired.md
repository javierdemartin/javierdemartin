The year is 2020. I am graduating in a month and the world is still quarantining. Nobody knows what the future holds.

I am not running out of money, I am working some hours as a freelancer and pay is currently good. I won't be able to live out of my current salary once I graduate but it's great for now.  I am grateful to have found the people I have found these years that have motivated me and allowed me to keep learning and work.

Throughout this year I have done some interviews with companies and only received one offer. I even interviewed for a dream company, so I guess I am doing things correctly.

Formally I am a Telecommunications Engineer, I have a deep passion for everything related to it, but also for software... I decided to learn Swift to make iOS apps on my sophomore year. I don't know why. I have convinced myself it was because I had an iPhone and I wanted to see my code run on a phone. I kept learning over the years until I landed a job so I started to see the bright side of it. I could get paid to do things I enjoyed.

Unluckily the programming courses I had didn't even taught us the basic O Notation or algorithms. So you can guess what my face was when I had to deal with that and also learn it on my own while nervouslsy preparing for interviews. I am still horrible at live coding intervies. That doesn't mean I am not able to perform or even write code but I get nervous because the other person's sole job is to watch me. When I have a home exercise I would say I am more comfortable or feel more confident.

I have received, I think, stupid rejections like I knew too much for the level they were looking for or that I knew more advanced concepts like Reactive Programming but failed to quickly response how much memory I needed to reserve in a special case for an array. This whole system is getting on my nerves because I don't know if I am even remotely good for "the system".

Companies should, and I guess they do, on the potential they see on people. I know technical screen interviews and algorithms can be a filter but they can also lead to false positives. Maybe I should study more algorithms instead of doing side projects on new and interesting things or work...
