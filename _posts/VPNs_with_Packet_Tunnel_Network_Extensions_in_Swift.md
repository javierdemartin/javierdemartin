The [Network Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension) framework is one of the most customizable frameworks that Apple provides. Allowing you to customize and extend the core networking features of iOS and macOS. 

While this article by [Alexander Grebenyuk][1] covers this topic in depth I would like to add some things I have learnt. 

I have recently worked on a project implementing a VPN using the OpenVPN protocol. This is not supported natively by the framework and it requires a third party library, I used [OpenVPNAdapter](https://github.com/ss-abramchuk/OpenVPNAdapter).

The WWDC sessions from [2015](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/717/), 2017 [Part 1](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/707)  and [Part 2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/709). Are specially useful to grasp essential points and know how this framework is used.

## Using the Packet Tunnel Extension to Implement a VPN

Imagine you want to tunnel all your outgoing traffic using the VPN connection. All your traffic will be sent to your VPN server, that is also your DNS server. This solution can be used to block certain websites, like gambling or adult content. You have to be sure that all the traffic is going out of your tunneled interface, if it doesn't your app won't be usable. That's what I've been working on using a [`Packet Tunnel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/packet_tunnel_provider) allowing me to implement a VPN client for a packet-oriented custom VPN protocol.

As this is going to be an app in the App Store I couldn't use an always on VPN as it requires managed devices and implementing an IKEv2 VPN solution. 

For unmanaged devices there are some things at our hand. Like playing around with the [on demand rules](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/personal_vpn/vpn_on_demand_rules). Allowing the system to automatically start a VPN connection based on different rules. In this case forcing the system to establish a tunnel whenever it acquires internet connectivity.


OpenVPN has implemented their own solution, [seamless tunnel](https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?t=20820). The implementation is not public but it seems to work so I'm going to try and create my own seamless solution that always redirects all the traffic through the tunnel.

Implementing a Packet Tunnel Network Extension will divide the app into two targets. Your main app where your app will reside and the target that subclasses  [`NEPacketTunnelProvider`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelprovider#). Subclassing this class will grant us access to a virtual network interface. Creating a packet tunnel provider requires to configure the `Info.plist` file.

The main app will only be in charge of doing tasks like user management downloading the VPN configuration... And the target will be doing all the networking operations: starting, stopping and managing all the states the tunnel could be in.

As there is not a lot of documentation or projects here are some of the things that explain how this framework works.

* As long as your device is charging the tunnel is kept alive. The `KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT` messages are used to sense the other side of the tunnel and make sure it's up/down. If your device is unplugged the tunnel could have died and your traffic will be going out using another interface.
* Higher level APIs like `URLSession` do not redirect traffic through the interface in the extension. Lower level APIs like [`createTCPConnectionThroughTunnel`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelprovider/1406055-createtcpconnectionthroughtunnel) can force traffic to go out of the tunnel.
* Some seconds after locking your screen the device goes to [sleep](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/993?cversion=0&cnum_hist=1). Override the [`sleep`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/neprovider/1406731-sleep#) and [`wake`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/neprovider/1406543-wake#) methods. In the first one you should quiesce the tunnel as appropiate and with the latter reactivate the tunnel. More info [here](https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/291454#291454).
* Network interface changes can be monitored by subscribing to [`defaultPath`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/neprovider/1406740-defaultpath), it's not a good idea to base your reconnecting logic on network changes. The standard approach is to monitor the path associated with your tunnel connection for: the path failing or a new tunnel connection and transition to that. [Source](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/122711).
* Understand your underlying tunnel infraestructure. That is, know if for example when transitioning from WiFi to Cellular you need to reset your tunnel. [Source](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/122711).
* Code inside the network extension is subject to [different rules](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/94430). A query using `URLSession` done from the network extension doesn't leave the tunnel using the tunnelled interface but this done from the main target the petition leaves the device using the tunnelled interface.
* Detecting if the tunnel is active is not an easy task. Using the [`OpenVPNAdapter`](https://github.com/ss-abramchuk/OpenVPNAdapter/blob/master/Sources/OpenVPNAdapter/OpenVPNAdapter.h) library there are some properties that are `nil` unless the tunnel is connected like `sessionName`. I've checked if this value is `nil` after waking up and in cases where the tunnel was not active the returning value wasn't `nil` so I am not sold on this.
* If you want to go full on having a 100% active tunnel at all costs you can check if a known endpoint is blocking, responding a [`HTTP 451`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_451) code, using the low level APIs. If a `HTTP 200` code is received the tunnel is not active and you can reset it. This is a very expensive option as it will query a website every time the device wakes. The waking process is not only done when you use the device, it's done by the system several times to do background tasks so the battery impact could be high. It's a bit hacky but it works.
* Another option is to read the log messages from the provider and act accordingly when a `KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT` message is received, meaning that your tunnel is no longer active. This is a much lower impact option that seems to work for me.
* There are some cases where a lot of rapid reconnections and changes will be fired and you will want to debounce your actions in this transient event until the connection is stable.
