Neural Bikes is now available for [BiciMAD](https://javierdemart.in/bicis/madrid). The training of the neural network was a big step from Bilbao. Bilbao has 40 bike docks, whereas Madrid has a bit over 200.

I've wanting to monetize this project for a while. I love working on it but it takes some of my free time away. Also, I am trying to move the server load from my old 2011 Mac Mini in my room to the cloud and that will mean recurring costs. I am adding a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/javierdemartin) button to donate money if the project is useful to you. I am trying to shift away from ads and trust in the donations. Let's see if it works!

This release also adds new endpoints for the API,
