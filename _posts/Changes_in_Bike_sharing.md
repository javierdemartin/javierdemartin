I have been gathering data of bike sharing availability services for a while. It's needed to train the neural networks that power [Neural Bikes](http://neural.bike). Amidst the current situation we are in I decided to check on New York's CitiBike service. The services in Spain have been shut down.

Amidst the current we are currently in most cities in the world have halted. That includes all means of transportation bike sharing for obvious reasons. In the case of New York City.
